    Client ID: your_client_id
    Client Secret: your_client_secret
    ```

## Verification

1.  **Create a folder inside the rclone associated folder in Google Drive.**

2.  **Test Commands:**

    ```bash
    rclone lsf my_remote: --dirs-only
        rclone lsd my_remote:
        rclone lsl my_remote:
        rclone tree my_remote:
        ```

    rclone size "remote_name:"
    rclone size "remote_name:/path/to/folder/"
    ```   ```

2. **Check latest backup files**

    ```bash
    rclone lsl "remote_name:/path/to/folder/" | sort -k2,2 | tail -n 2
  
3. **Restore latest files from Google Drive:**

    ```bash
    read -p "How many latest backup files do you want to copy? (1 or 2): " NUM && [[ "$NUM" == "1" || "$NUM" == "2" ]] && rclone lsl "remote_name:/path/to/folder/" | sort -k2,2 | tail -n $NUM | awk '{print $NF}' | xargs -I{} rclone copy -v "server_silkroademart:backup_silkroademart/{}" /website_backups --progress || echo "Invalid input. Please enter 1 or 2."
    ```

    0 5 */1 * * /usr/bin/rclone copy /path/to/backup "remote_name:" --log-file=/var/log/rclone.log
